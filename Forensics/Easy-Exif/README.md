https://mega.nz/#!SDpF0aYC!fkkhBJuBBtBKGsLTDiF2NuLihP2WRd97Iynd3PhWqRw You could really ‘own’ it with exif.

## Solution
This challenge was quite easy only thing you have to do is to download  
the picture and open its HEX dump. I used website http://icyberchef.com/   
and the plugin "To Hexdump". Then I just scroll a little bit and found the flag.

## Flag
> **flag{3l1t3_3x1f_4uth0r1ty_dud3br0}**
