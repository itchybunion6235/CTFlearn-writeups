## Solution
This challenge was quite easy only thing you have to do is to download  
the picture and open its HEX dump plus calculate some equations. I used website http://icyberchef.com/   
and the plugin "To Hexdump". Then I just scroll a little bit and found the flag.  
> CTFlearn{I_Like_Math_x_y} where x and y are the solution to these equations: 3x+5y=31 7x+9y=59  
After I solved the equations I substituted the x and y in the flag and VoilÃ , here comes the flag.
